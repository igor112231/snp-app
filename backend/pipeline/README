# Requirements

- AWK (`awk`)
- ViennaRNA (`RNApdist`, `RNAfold`, `RNAdistance`, `RNAplot`)
- Ghostscript (`eps2eps`)
- Texlive (`epstopdf`)
- pdf2svg (`pdf2svg`)
- svgo (`svgo`)

# Running

1. Create a new directory and change into it
2. Put wild-type sequence in wt.txt and mutant in mut.txt
3. Execute `01-RNApdist`
4. Execute `02-RNAfold`
5. Execute `03-RNAdistance`
6. Execute `04-RNAplot`

# Results

- `RNApdist-result.txt`: distance computed by RNApdist
- `wt-dotbracket.txt` and `mut-dotbracket.txt`: 2D structure predicted by RNAfold
- `RNAdistance-result.txt`: nine distances computer by RNAdistance using various methods
- `RNAdistance-backtrack.txt`: backtracking of RNAdistance showing where the differences are
- `mut-dotbracket.svg`: 2D structure visualization displaying in red the modified nucleotides
- `wt-dotbracket.svg`: 2D structure visualization displaying in blue the modified nucleotides
